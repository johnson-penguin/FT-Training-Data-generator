    1. Make sure the configured local IP address is assigned to an interface on your host (check with `ip a`).
    2. In simulation or containerized environments, prefer loopback or virtual interface IPs (e.g., `127.0.0.X`).
    3. Failure in socket binding means no SCTP association or GTP-U path can be established, breaking F1-C and N3 interfaces respectively.
    4. Double-check the config file for misconfigured IPs under F1 and GTP-U sections.

  notes: |
    1. The configuration file contains a syntax error â€” check for missing semicolons, brackets, or incorrect data types.
    2. `libconfig` uses strict syntax: key-value pairs must end with `;` and sections with `{}` must be properly closed.
    3. Use a config linter or double-check the reported line manually.
    4. Until this is fixed, the CU process will not proceed past configuration loading.

  notes: |
    This error indicates that the CU rejected the F1AP setup request from the DU, likely due to a mismatch in configuration parameters such as PLMN, gNB_DU_id, gNB_DU_name, or TAC.
    Ensure that these parameters are consistent and correctly set in both DU and CU configuration files.
    A mismatch will prevent the DU from establishing an F1 interface with the CU.

  notes: |
    The DU is waiting for an F1 Setup Response from the CU but does not receive it, often due to a configuration mismatch (such as remote_n_address, PLMN, gNB_DU_id, or gNB_DU_name).
    Ensure that all relevant parameters are consistent and correctly set in both DU and CU configuration files.
    This issue will prevent the DU from activating its radio and completing the F1 setup.


- stage: cu_init

  related_config:

    The 'Active_gNBs' parameter should be a list of gNB names (e.g., Active_gNBs = ("gNB-Eurecom-CU");)
    that correspond exactly to the 'gNB_name' fields declared in the 'gNBs' section.

    This error occurs when the configured gNB name in Active_gNBs is missing or not defined under 'gNBs',
    resulting in nb_nr_inst = 0 and triggering an assertion failure.

    Ensure all names match exactly (case-sensitive) and that each name in Active_gNBs has a corresponding
    configuration block with matching gNB_name.

    - "RC.nb_nr_L1_inst = 0"
  related_config:
    - Active_gNBs
    - gNB_name
  notes: |
    If Active_gNBs does not match the gNB_name defined in the gNBs section,
    the CU will initialize incorrectly, with invalid PLMN or zero RRC instances.
    Ensure both values match exactly (case-sensitive).


- stage: cu_config_parsing
  symptom: "CU failed to start due to syntax error in configuration file"
  log_snippet: "syntax error"

  notes: |
    The value for 'Num_Threads_PUSCH' is not a valid integer.
    Ensure all numeric parameters in the config file are set to valid values.
    In this case, 'asdasfsad' caused a parsing failure. Recommended value: 4 or 8.
